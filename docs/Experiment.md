## Example

```python
from talon_one.models.experiment import Experiment

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Experiment from a JSON string
experiment_instance = Experiment.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Experiment.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
experiment_dict = experiment_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Experiment from a dict
experiment_from_dict = Experiment.from_dict(experiment_dict)

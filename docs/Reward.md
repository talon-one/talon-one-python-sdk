**visibility_conditions** | [**Rule**](Rule.md) | An optional rule that manages who can see this reward. If not specified, the reward is visible to all customers.  **Note:** Only the &#x60;condition&#x60; field is evaluated within this rule.

**rule** | [**Rule**](Rule.md) | Rule to apply.  **Note**: The &#x60;bindings&#x60; field inside the rule must not be used in this endpoint. All bindings should be defined at the reward level via the top-level &#x60;bindings&#x60; field.  | [optional] 
**bindings** | [**List[Binding]**](Binding.md) | A list of named variables created before the reward&#39;s rules are evaluated.  Each binding pairs a name with a talang expression. The expression is evaluated once  and its result is available by name in any rule condition or effect. Bindings must be defined outside of individual rules. | [optional] 
**modified** | **datetime** | The timestamp when the reward was last updated in RFC3339 format. | [optional]

## Example

```python
from talon_one.models.reward import Reward

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Reward from a JSON string
reward_instance = Reward.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Reward.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
reward_dict = reward_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Reward from a dict
reward_from_dict = Reward.from_dict(reward_dict)
```
